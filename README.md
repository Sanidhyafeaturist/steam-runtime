# Steam Runtime SDK

A binary compatible runtime environment for Steam applications on Linux.

## Introduction

The Linux version of Steam runs on many Linux distributions, ranging from the latest rolling-release distributions like Arch Linux to older LTS distributions like Ubuntu 14.04. To achieve this, it uses a special library stack, the *Steam Runtime*, which is installed in `~/.steam/root/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime`. This is Steam Runtime version 1, codenamed `scout` after the Team Fortress 2 character class.

The Steam client itself is run in an environment that adds the shared libraries from Steam Runtime 1 'scout' to the library loading path, using the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This is referred to as the [`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][LD_LIBRARY_PATH runtime]. Most native Linux games available through Steam are also run in this environment.

A newer approach to cross-distribution compatibility is to use Linux namespace (container) technology, to run games in a more predictable environment, even when running on an arbitrary Linux distribution which might be old, new, or unusually set up. This is implemented as a series of Steam Play compatibility tools and is referred to as the Steam [container runtime][container runtime] or the *Steam Linux Runtime*.

The Steam Runtime is also used by the [Proton][Proton] Steam Play compatibility tools, which run Windows games on Linux systems. Older versions of Proton (5.0 or earlier) use the same 'scout' [`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][LD_LIBRARY_PATH runtime] as most native Linux games. Newer versions of Proton (5.13 or newer) use a [container runtime][container runtime] with newer library versions: this is Steam Runtime version 2, codenamed 'soldier'.

More information about the [`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][LD_LIBRARY_PATH runtime] and [container runtime][container runtime] is available as part of the [steam-runtime-tools documentation][steam-runtime-tools documentation].

## Why Use Steam Runtime SDK?

- Ensures your application finds the correct libraries for smooth operation on different Linux systems.
- Prevents conflicts between development libraries on your machine and the libraries your application needs.

## Detailed Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Podman or Docker**: Choose one of these container tools. Installation instructions for both can be found here:
  - [Install Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
  - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

- **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Familiarity with terminal commands will help you navigate the installation process.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Podman or Docker** (if not already installed):

   For **Ubuntu/Debian**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install podman
    ```

## or for Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
## Download the SDK:


## Depending on the container tool you chose, run one of the following commands:

## For Podman:

```bash
podman pull registry.gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk
```
## For Docker:

```bash
sudo docker pull registry.gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk
```
## Create a Container Environment:

Once the download is complete, create a new container environment by running:

## For Podman:

```bash
podman run -it --rm --name steamrt-sdk registry.gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk /bin/bash
```

## For Docker:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm --name steamrt-sdk registry.gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk /bin/bash
```
## (Optional) Chroot Environment:

If you prefer a chroot environment, download the appropriate image from the Steam Runtime repository: Steam Runtime Repository. Follow the instructions provided with the downloaded image to set up the chroot.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips
Permission Denied Errors: If you encounter permission issues, ensure that you are running the commands with the correct privileges (e.g., using sudo for Docker).

Container Fails to Start: If the container fails to start, check your installation of Podman or Docker. Verify that itâ€™s running correctly by checking the service status:

### For Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

For Podman:

```bash
systemctl --user status podman
```

## Outdated Libraries: Ensure your system packages are up to date. Run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
### Further Resources
For more detailed information on using the Steam Runtime SDK, refer to the official documentation.

If you run into issues, check the steam-runtime issue tracker for potential solutions or report a new issue.

### Additional Information
Debugging: If you need to use debugging tools like gdb, follow the instructions in the section on using detached debug symbols.
Reporting Bugs and Issues
Please report issues to the steam-runtime issue tracker.

The container runtimes have some known issues which do not need to be reported again.

The container runtime is quite complicated, so we will need additional information to be able to make progress on resolving issues. this convert into markdown
